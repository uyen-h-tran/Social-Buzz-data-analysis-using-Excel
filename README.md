# Scenario

Social Buzz, a social media and content creation company, has grown rapidly in recent years and now seeks external help to manage its growth. Accenture has begun a 3-month initial project to audit Social Buzz's big data practice, recommend strategies for a successful IPO, and analyze Social Buzz's content categories to identify the top 5 most popular categories.

I am working as a Data Analyst at Accenture within a larger team, where each member has a different role and level of responsibility. My task is to analyze sample data sets with visualizations to understand the popularity of different content categories based on reaction scores.

The client has sent through 7 data sets, each with different columns and values, and a data model showing the relationships between all of the data sets, as well as any links that I can use to merge tables. However, I only need the following three data sets to complete my task:

- Reaction
- Content
- Reaction Types

I will use a presentation to present the main points of your analysis, including:

- Project Recap
- Problem
- The Analytics Team
- Process
- Insights
- Suggestions
